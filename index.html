        >s cat. I love the smell of a Brazilian panettone, but I'm not allowed
        to try it because it's not good for me. In fact my favorite food is corn
        but Melissa could not get a good picture of me eating corn, I looked
        more like a scary ocelot. In real life I'm pretty sweet with who cares
        about me but I can be fierce as an ocelot. This page was originally
        built in a different format, in the form of a virtual Bday card for
        Melissa's friends & family, and they loved it without caring much about
        her beginner programmer skills😁 Thanks for understanding that my
        picture above belongs to Melissa & her family and its commercial use is
        strictly prohibited 😎
